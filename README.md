# Coffee-Automatic-Dispenser
Abstract: 
	In this project, we will be using the robotic arm to assist us in envisioning the way we can assort, organize and deliver food in the manufacturing industry. In this specific project we will be developing a coffee maker where it assembles the drink into what the consumer desires and choose. In many cases, physical labor with human capabilities in fast food restaurants can depreciate over time and induce physical stress among the employees. With the assistance of robotics, we can help workers reduce the amount of physical labor that a normal employee has to handle, reduce production costs and while also delivering a consistent product that satisfies the consumer. 
	By making a coffee-making system with a robotic we are able to successfully assort, organize and deliver the consumer product to the customer in an efficient way. These steps include:
The customer chooses a selected drink and however, they customized
The cup is dispensed from the cup dispenser.
The cup is pushed on the conveyor belt & stops by the coffee machine.
The Machine makes the cup of coffee depending on the choice of the customer.
The finished coffee cup is handed off to the customer through the conveyor.
